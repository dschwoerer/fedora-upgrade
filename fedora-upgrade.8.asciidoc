DESCRIPTION
-----------

Script *fedora-upgrade* tries to automate steps needed for dnf-upgrade from one major version to next one.

Steps which fedora-upgrade does:

* Display usual warnings.
* Check dependencies.
* Resolve old .rpmsave and .rpmnew files before upgrading (if there are some).
* Download and import RPM GPG keys.
* Run "dnf --releasever=$TOVER distro-sync".
* Install missing packages from group 'Minimal Install'.
* Resolve old .rpmsave and .rpmnew files after upgrade.
* Reset priorities of services.

--tmpfs=SIZE - When performing online upgrade and you have small /var/cache/dnf then this option will mount /var/cache/dnf as tmpfs with specified size. The SIZE can be anything what accepts `mount` command. E.g. "3G". The mount point is unmounted when dnf finishes.
